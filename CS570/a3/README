Files in the project:
    makefile
    p3.h
    p3helper.c 
    p3main.c
    README

Compile Instructions:
>>> make
Just run the make file.
If you would like to get rid of the object files, you can "make clean" by activating the clean routine in the makefile.

Operating instructions:
>>>./a3 in order to run the executable (we have taken the default value of 6 seconds)

List of significant design ideas:
We had the main template i.e the main functions in the p3main.c 
The helper functions i.e the two routines to be executed by the two child processes are in the p3helper.c

List of extra features: 
N/A

List of known bugs:
N/A

Lessons learned:
We learned how to implement an interruptable clock and countdown timer for the two child processes
Use of countdown timer to notify one child process when its sibling to terminate.
